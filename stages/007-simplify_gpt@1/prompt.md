# refactor: Remove IP allowlisting

## Overview

Remove Fabro's inbound server IP allowlisting feature completely. This removes the
server-wide `[server.ip_allowlist]` setting, the GitHub webhook-specific
`[server.integrations.github.webhooks.ip_allowlist]` overlay, request middleware,
client-IP extraction, GitHub `/meta` hook-range expansion, settings API exposure,
generated API client types, and the Settings > Security UI display.

Existing configs that still contain removed IP allowlist keys should fail as
unknown fields. This is an intentional hard removal, not a compatibility
deprecation.

## Problem Frame

The feature is being removed from Fabro rather than maintained as an in-process
network access-control layer. Network source restrictions should be handled
outside Fabro by reverse proxies, firewalls, VPNs, Tailscale, platform ingress,
or other deployment-layer controls.

## Requirements Trace

- R1. Remove all runtime enforcement of inbound source-IP allowlisting from web,
  API, static asset, and GitHub webhook routes.
- R2. Remove the server settings schema for global and GitHub webhook IP
  allowlists.
- R3. Remove `IpAllowEntry` and related API schema/client types from public
  settings payloads.
- R4. Keep unrelated allowlists intact: GitHub username allowlists, sandbox
  egress CIDR allow lists, and internal policy/test allowlists.
- R5. Preserve existing authentication, GitHub webhook HMAC verification,
  routing, health checks, request logging, and settings hot-reload behavior.
- R6. Treat old IP allowlist config as invalid after removal.
- R7. Update operator-facing docs/changelog so users know to move source-IP
  restrictions upstream.

## Scope Boundaries

- Do not remove `[server.auth.github].allowed_usernames`.
- Do not remove Daytona/sandbox `cidr_allow_list` network policy support.
- Do not remove generic uses of "allowlist" in policy tests, markdown rendering,
  model controls, or other unrelated domains.
- Do not add a migration, warning-only parser, or fallback compatibility path for
  old IP allowlist settings.
- Do not change GitHub webhook signature verification or webhook route strategy.

## Context & Research

### Relevant Code and Patterns

- Settings use sparse config layers in `lib/crates/fabro-config/src/layers/`
  and dense resolved types in `lib/crates/fabro-types/src/settings/`.
- The OpenAPI spec at `docs/public/api-reference/fabro-api.yaml` is the source
  of truth for API wire shape; `cargo build -p fabro-api` regenerates Rust API
  code, and `cd lib/packages/fabro-api-client && bun run generate` regenerates
  the TypeScript client.
- `lib/crates/fabro-server/src/server.rs` builds the router and currently wires
  IP allowlist middleware before other route dispatch behavior.
- `lib/crates/fabro-server/src/serve.rs` currently resolves server and webhook
  allowlist configs at startup and creates a GitHub `/meta` resolver.
- `apps/fabro-web/app/routes/settings-security.tsx` displays the settings API's
  `server.ip_allowlist` state.

### Main Removal Surfaces

- Config/types: `fabro-types`, `fabro-config`, config tests.
- Server runtime: `fabro-server/src/ip_allowlist.rs`, router wiring, startup
  wiring, test helpers, routing/TCP tests.
- API/contracts: OpenAPI schema, `fabro-api` type replacements/exports, generated
  TypeScript API client models.
- Frontend/docs: Settings > Security copy, settings navigation copy, changelog.

## Key Technical Decisions

- **Hard removal:** Removed config keys should fail through existing
  `deny_unknown_fields` behavior. This keeps the change simple and makes stale
  deployment config visible immediately.
- **Delete, do not stub:** Remove `IpAllowlistConfig` and middleware parameters
  instead of passing default empty configs through the router. Empty stubs would
  keep the feature shape alive and make future cleanup harder.
- **Keep webhook auth unchanged:** GitHub webhook source-IP filtering goes away,
  but HMAC signature verification remains the security boundary for webhook
  payload authenticity.
- **Generated clients follow OpenAPI:** Update the OpenAPI schemas first, then
  regenerate Rust and TypeScript API outputs rather than hand-editing generated
  client files except as a short-term cleanup if generation leaves stale exports.
- **Docs mention upstream controls:** The changelog and security guidance should
  direct operators to network-layer controls, not a replacement Fabro setting.

## Implementation Units

- [ ] **Unit 1: Remove config schema and resolved types**

**Goal:** Delete the IP allowlist settings contract from config parsing and dense
server settings.

**Requirements:** R2, R3, R4, R6

**Dependencies:** None

**Files:**
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-types/src/settings/server.rs`
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-types/src/settings/mod.rs`
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-types/Cargo.toml`
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-config/src/layers/server.rs`
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-config/src/layers/mod.rs`
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-config/src/lib.rs`
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-config/src/resolve/server.rs`
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-config/src/tests/resolve_server.rs`

**Approach:**
- Remove `ServerNamespace.ip_allowlist` and its `test_default()` population.
- Delete `ServerIpAllowlistSettings`, `ServerIpAllowlistOverrideSettings`, and
  `IpAllowEntry`.
- Remove `ServerLayer.ip_allowlist`, `ServerIpAllowlistLayer`,
  `ServerIpAllowlistOverrideLayer`, and `IntegrationWebhooksLayer.ip_allowlist`.
- Remove resolver functions and validation for global and webhook IP allowlists,
  including `github_meta_hooks` parsing and Unix socket trusted-proxy checks.
- Remove `ipnet` from `fabro-types`. Keep `ipnet` in `fabro-config` because
  `resolve/environment.rs` still validates sandbox CIDR policy.
- Replace old positive/negative IP allowlist config tests with unknown-field
  tests for `[server.ip_allowlist]` and
  `[server.integrations.github.webhooks.ip_allowlist]`.

**Patterns to follow:**
- Existing unknown-field tests in `lib/crates/fabro-config/src/tests/resolve_server.rs`
  for retired server settings.
- Existing `ServerLayer`/`ServerNamespace` layer-to-resolved pattern for removing
  a server subdomain cleanly.

**Test scenarios:**
- Error path: TOML with `[server.ip_allowlist]` fails parsing/resolution with an
  unknown-field diagnostic mentioning `ip_allowlist`.
- Error path: TOML with `[server.integrations.github.webhooks.ip_allowlist]`
  fails with an unknown-field diagnostic mentioning `ip_allowlist`.
- Happy path: minimal valid server settings still resolve without any
  `ip_allowlist` field.
- Integration: serialized `ServerSettings` JSON no longer includes
  `server.ip_allowlist`.

**Verification:**
- `fabro-config` and `fabro-types` compile without removed IP allowlist symbols.
- Config tests prove stale allowlist settings are rejected.

- [ ] **Unit 2: Remove server middleware and startup resolution**

**Goal:** Remove all runtime source-IP filtering and GitHub `/meta` range
resolution from `fabro-server`.

**Requirements:** R1, R4, R5

**Dependencies:** Unit 1

**Files:**
- Delete: `lib/crates/fabro-server/src/ip_allowlist.rs`
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-server/src/lib.rs`
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-server/src/server.rs`
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-server/src/serve.rs`
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-server/src/test_support.rs`
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-server/Cargo.toml`
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-server/src/auth/translate.rs`
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-server/src/web_auth.rs`
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-cli/tests/it/support/auth_harness.rs`

**Approach:**
- Remove the public `ip_allowlist` module export.
- Delete `IpAllowlistConfig`, `IpAllowlist`, `GitHubMetaResolver`, client-IP
  extraction, middleware, and GitHub meta cache helpers.
- Simplify `build_router_with_options` by removing its `Arc<IpAllowlistConfig>`
  parameter and removing `RouterOptions.github_webhook_ip_allowlist`.
- Remove the global allowlist middleware layer from the main app router.
- Simplify `github_webhook_routes` so it only receives the webhook secret and no
  route-specific allowlist config.
- Remove startup creation of `GitHubMetaResolver`, `default_ip_allowlist`,
  `resolve_github_webhook_ip_allowlist`, and
  `resolve_startup_github_webhook_ip_allowlist`.
- Replace all test/helper call sites that pass `IpAllowlistConfig::default()`
  with the simplified router signature.
- Remove `ipnet` and any now-unused HTTP mocking/test-only dependencies from
  `fabro-server` if they are only used by the deleted module.
- Consider whether `serve.rs` still needs `SocketAddr` for TCP
  `ConnectInfo`; if it was only present for allowlisting tests, remove the
  connect-info service wrapper and imports.

**Patterns to follow:**
- Keep router layers ordered as they are after the allowlist layer is removed:
  auth translation, demo routing, auth extension, canonical host, security
  headers, HTTP logging, request ID.
- Existing webhook route HMAC tests and auth tests should remain the source of
  truth for webhook behavior.

**Test scenarios:**
- Happy path: API requests from any TCP remote address route normally when auth
  requirements are satisfied.
- Happy path: `/health` remains accessible.
- Integration: GitHub webhook route still rejects missing/invalid signatures and
  accepts valid signatures exactly as before.
- Cleanup: there are no references to `IpAllowlistConfig`, `ip_allowlist_middleware`,
  `GitHubMetaResolver`, `github_meta_hooks`, or `github-meta-hooks.json`.

**Verification:**
- `fabro-server` and CLI auth harness tests compile against the simplified router
  API.
- Runtime startup no longer performs any GitHub `/meta` fetch for webhook IP
  ranges.

- [ ] **Unit 3: Update OpenAPI and generated API clients**

**Goal:** Remove IP allowlist fields and schemas from public settings API
contracts and regenerated clients.

**Requirements:** R3, R4

**Dependencies:** Units 1 and 2

**Files:**
- Modify: `docs/public/api-reference/fabro-api.yaml`
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-api/build.rs`
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-api/src/lib.rs`
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-api/tests/server_settings_round_trip.rs`
- Modify/generated: `lib/packages/fabro-api-client/src/models/*`

**Approach:**
- Remove `ip_allowlist` from `ServerNamespace.required` and
  `ServerNamespace.properties`.
- Remove `ServerIpAllowlistSettings`,
  `ServerIpAllowlistOverrideSettings`, `IpAllowEntry`,
  `LiteralIpAllowEntry`, and `GitHubMetaHooksEntry` schemas.
- Remove `IntegrationWebhooksSettings.ip_allowlist` from required/properties.
- Remove `with_replacement` entries and public re-exports for removed types in
  `fabro-api`.
- Regenerate Rust API code by building `fabro-api`.
- Regenerate TypeScript Axios client and ensure stale allowlist model files and
  index exports are gone.
- Strengthen round-trip tests to assert settings JSON omits
  `server.ip_allowlist` and webhook `ip_allowlist`.

**Patterns to follow:**
- Existing OpenAPI-first workflow in `AGENTS.md`.
- Existing `server_settings_family_reuses_domain_types` assertions for shared
  domain type identity.

**Test scenarios:**
- Contract: `ServerSettings` round-trips through API types without any IP
  allowlist field.
- Contract: OpenAPI-generated TypeScript `ServerNamespace` has no
  `ip_allowlist` property.
- Contract: `IntegrationWebhooksSettings` has only webhook strategy fields after
  removal.

**Verification:**
- Generated Rust and TypeScript clients match the updated OpenAPI spec.
- `rg "ServerIpAllowlist|IpAllowEntry|server-ip-allowlist|literal-ip-allow-entry"`
  finds no remaining generated/public API references.

- [ ] **Unit 4: Update web settings UI**

**Goal:** Remove IP allowlist display from Settings > Security and align copy
with the new settings shape.

**Requirements:** R3, R7

**Dependencies:** Unit 3

**Files:**
- Modify: `apps/fabro-web/app/routes/settings-security.tsx`
- Modify: `apps/fabro-web/app/routes/settings.tsx`

**Approach:**
- Change the Security page description from "Authentication methods and network
  allowlist" to authentication-only wording.
- Remove destructuring and rendering of `settings.server.ip_allowlist`.
- Remove the unused `Count` and `plural` imports if no longer used.
- Update the Settings nav description for Security from "Authentication and
  network allowlist" to authentication-focused copy.

**Patterns to follow:**
- Existing `settings-panel` row layout for Auth methods and Allowed usernames.

**Test scenarios:**
- Typecheck: the route compiles against the regenerated API client with no
  `server.ip_allowlist` property.
- UI behavior: Security page still renders auth methods and allowed usernames.
- Cleanup: no frontend references to `ip_allowlist`, `IP allowlist`, or
  `trusted_proxy_count` remain.

**Verification:**
- `apps/fabro-web` typecheck passes against the new generated client.

- [ ] **Unit 5: Update tests, docs, changelog, and dependency lockfile**

**Goal:** Remove stale references and document the operator-facing behavior
change.

**Requirements:** R4, R6, R7

**Dependencies:** Units 1 through 4

**Files:**
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-server/tests/it/api/routing.rs`
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-server/tests/it/api/tcp.rs`
- Modify: `lib/crates/fabro-server/tests/it/api/settings.rs`
- Modify: `docs/public/administration/security.mdx`
- Create or modify: `docs/public/changelog/2026-05-27.mdx`
- Modify: `Cargo.lock` if dependency graph changes

**Approach:**
- Delete route/TCP tests that only prove IP allowlist enforcement or
  `ConnectInfo` behavior.
- Adjust any router setup helpers after the signature simplification.
- Add a settings API assertion that `server.ip_allowlist` is absent from
  `/api/v1/settings`.
- Update security docs to explicitly state that Fabro does not provide inbound
  source-IP allowlisting and operators should use upstream network controls.
- Add a changelog entry dated 2026-05-27 describing the hard removal and the
  expected replacement at the deployment layer.
- Run dependency resolution after removing direct `ipnet`/test dependencies;
  keep transitive or unrelated `ipnet` entries needed by sandbox CIDR validation.

**Patterns to follow:**
- Existing changelog style in `docs/public/changelog/2026-05-26.mdx`.
- Existing settings API integration test style in
  `lib/crates/fabro-server/tests/it/api/settings.rs`.

**Test scenarios:**
- Settings API: response contains server auth, listen, storage, scheduler, and
  integrations fields, but not `server.ip_allowlist`.
- Config compatibility: old IP allowlist TOML fails before startup rather than
  being silently ignored.
- Docs validation: security docs no longer imply Fabro can restrict inbound
  source IPs internally.

**Verification:**
- `rg -n "ip_allowlist|trusted_proxy_count|github_meta_hooks|IP allowlist|ip allowlist"`
  returns only historical archived plan/brainstorm/spec references or unrelated
  non-server allowlist text.

## System-Wide Impact

- **Public API:** `GET /api/v1/settings` response shape changes by removing
  `server.ip_allowlist` and webhook `ip_allowlist`.
- **Config compatibility:** Existing `settings.toml` files containing the removed
  keys become invalid. This is intentional.
- **Runtime security posture:** Fabro no longer blocks requests based on source
  IP. Operators must enforce network source restrictions upstream.
- **Webhook handling:** GitHub webhook HMAC verification remains unchanged; only
  optional source-IP filtering is removed.
- **Generated clients:** Downstream TypeScript/Rust consumers that read
  `server.ip_allowlist` must update.

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Operators accidentally expose a server that previously relied on Fabro IP allowlisting | Changelog and security docs explicitly call out the removal and direct operators to upstream controls. |
| Generated API clients retain stale types | Update OpenAPI first, regenerate both Rust and TypeScript clients, and run search checks for stale symbols. |
| Unrelated allowlist functionality is removed by broad search/replace | Scope searches to `IpAllow`, `ip_allowlist`, `trusted_proxy_count`, and `github_meta_hooks`; preserve sandbox CIDR and GitHub username allowlists. |
| Router signature cleanup breaks many tests | Update shared test helpers first, then compile-driven cleanup of remaining call sites. |
| `ipnet` is removed where still needed | Keep `fabro-config` dependency if environment CIDR validation still imports `ipnet::IpNet`. |

## Test Plan

- `cargo build -p fabro-api`
- `cd lib/packages/fabro-api-client && bun run generate`
- `cargo nextest run -p fabro-config -p fabro-types -p fabro-api -p fabro-server`
- `cd apps/fabro-web && bun run typecheck`
- `cd apps/fabro-web && bun test`
- `cargo +nightly-2026-04-14 fmt --check --all`
- `cargo +nightly-2026-04-14 clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`

## Assumptions

- The accepted compatibility policy is hard removal: no warning-only parser, no
  migration, and no custom compatibility error path.
- Public API consumers can tolerate a breaking settings shape change for this
  removed feature.
- Historical documents in `docs/plans/`, `docs/brainstorms/`, and
  `docs/superpowers/` are archival and do not need rewriting.

# Simplify: Code Review and Cleanup

Review changes vs. origin for reuse, quality, and efficiency. Fix any issues found.

## Phase 1: Identify Changes

Run git diff (or git diff HEAD if there are staged changes) to see what changed. If there are no git changes, review the most recently modified files that the user mentioned or that you edited earlier in this conversation.

## Phase 2: Launch Three Review Agents in Parallel

Use the Agent tool to launch all three agents concurrently in a single message. Pass each agent the full diff so it has the complete context.

### Agent 1: Code Reuse Review

For each change:

1. Search for existing utilities and helpers that could replace newly written code. Use Grep to find similar patterns elsewhere in the codebase — common locations are utility directories, shared modules, and files adjacent to the changed ones.
2. Flag any new function that duplicates existing functionality. Suggest the existing function to use instead.
3. Flag any inline logic that could use an existing utility — hand-rolled string manipulation, manual path handling, custom environment checks, ad-hoc type guards, and similar patterns are common candidates.

Note: This is a greenfield app, so focus on maximizing simplicity and don't worry about changing things to achieve it.

### Agent 2: Code Quality Review

Review the same changes for hacky patterns:

1. Redundant state: state that duplicates existing state, cached values that could be derived, observers/effects that could be direct calls
2. Parameter sprawl: adding new parameters to a function instead of generalizing or restructuring existing ones
3. Copy-paste with slight variation: near-duplicate code blocks that should be unified with a shared abstraction
4. Leaky abstractions: exposing internal details that should be encapsulated, or breaking existing abstraction boundaries
5. Stringly-typed code: using raw strings where constants, enums (string unions), or branded types already exist in the codebase

Note: This is a greenfield app, so be aggressive in optimizing quality.

### Agent 3: Efficiency Review

Review the same changes for efficiency:

1. Unnecessary work: redundant computations, repeated file reads, duplicate network/API calls, N+1 patterns
2. Missed concurrency: independent operations run sequentially when they could run in parallel
3. Hot-path bloat: new blocking work added to startup or per-request/per-render hot paths
4. Unnecessary existence checks: pre-checking file/resource existence before operating (TOCTOU anti-pattern) — operate directly and handle the error
5. Memory: unbounded data structures, missing cleanup, event listener leaks
6. Overly broad operations: reading entire files when only a portion is needed, loading all items when filtering for one

## Phase 3: Fix Issues

Wait for all three agents to complete. Aggregate their findings and fix each issue directly. If a finding is a false positive or not worth addressing, note it and move on — do not argue with the finding, just skip it.

When done, briefly summarize what was fixed (or confirm the code was already clean).
